These are things that I plan to do in the near future
=====================================================

To be able to assemble, run and use the http://mdfs.net/Software/Z80/Exerciser/
Z80 exercisers ZEXALL and ZEXDOC. At this moment lxzasm cannot deal with them
because Macros are not supported and perhaps a few additional directives. This could
be a good tester for the whole kit. So I have work for the next couple of weeks

Assembler:
   To add the include  directive
   To support MACROS
   Implement INTEL/HEX output for the assembler
   Consider the LIST NOLIST directives
   Consider the ASEG CSEG directives
   I have 3 reduce/reduce conflicts in the grammar due to LD xx,( expr ) instructions. I need to sort out this.
      
Emulator: 
   Add support for more undocumented features, some already implemented.
   Missing IM 2.
   Review behaviour of I and R registers
